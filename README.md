# Criteria A-Planning

## Problem Definition
I am a teen chef who is passionate about food and solving inequality in society. I see that the interconnected issues of food insecurity and food waste are vital. The problem is that people are not aware that the problems exist, so they throw away foods that are still fresh and edible. Restaurants and hotels do that on a larger scale. Some restaurants may have been giving away leftover food, but not all people who face hunger know about where these giveaways take place, or what kind of food is being donated. Restaurants and hotels need a platform to share what foods they are giving away to spread the words. Some restaurants may have problems with keeping track of the giveaways they have done, so they need an organized separated system to keep track of the foods that have been donated. As I am studying about this issue, I would like to see an overview of the whole donations that has happened by different restaurants. The most important thing is that I want people to be mindful that the platform is for those who are facing food insecurity and for the planet, so that no one takes the food for granted.
